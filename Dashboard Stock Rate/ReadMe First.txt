Since my dataset(indexProcessed.csv) is too big (more than 14k+ rows) because I worked on three Stock Market data i.e HSI, N225, GSPTSE.
So, I randomly selected 100 rows from each Stock Data and make separate csv files of each Stock Rate like HSI.csv, N225.csv and GSPTSE.csv and then represent it on Dashboarding.

I made this dashboard by using python flask for rendering my data and HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
