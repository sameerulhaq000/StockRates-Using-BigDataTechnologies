1) First I downloaded and setup my Kafka Server.

2) Then I start Kafka Server and Zookeeper.

3) Then I created Kafka Topics for my project named as IBD-Projectt.

4) Then I start Kafka Producer and Consumer.

5) Then I ran Python script from Jupyter Notebook to check if Consumer is receiving the Data from Kafka Producer.

I used the below website to setup and configure my Kafka Server on Ubuntu:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-kafka-on-ubuntu-20-04

and for fixing errors I used Stackoverflow.
